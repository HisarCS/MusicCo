MusicCo aims to teach the principles of music creation through hands-on experience for kids K-6. It enables users to create beats, melodies; play their compositions with their friends; track their success in playing those melodies. With a variety of instruments, MusicCo creates a fun and interactive learning environment. Its design enables kids to use a combination of the twelve keys -an octave-, switch between octave’s using the octave button. With two octaves they can play all sorts of songs. The easy, medium, and hard levels for each song in the learning mode, measures the note and beat accuracy, helping track progress. Features like light based indication and vibration on press give haptic feedback, helping the user to gain motor abilities. Users can select different instruments, modes from the touch screen. The LEDs on both sides of the screen change according to the genre of music, creating a different atmosphere. Using the ESP-now protocol, MusicCo fosters collaboration by allowing kids to connect their devices and play together in a band-like setting. As an open-source project, MusicCo’s design and code are freely accessible, ensuring inclusivity and adaptability. It combines fun, creativity, and collaboration to provide a comprehensive learning experience for young musicians.
